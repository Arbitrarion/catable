Catable was created because I found myself needing a way to transfer files to machines that I had extremely limited access to. Generally this is a situation when I have a reverse shell to a machine but nothing else.

Catable creates a script that recreates the original file on the other machine. This script can be copied into the terminal, making it incredible convienient.

Usage: catable.py <file>
